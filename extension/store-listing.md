# PhishGuard — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Extension Name
PhishGuard — AI Phishing Shield

## Summary (132 chars max)
Real-time AI phishing detection. Blocks credential theft, brand spoofing,
and zero-day attacks before they reach you.

## Description
PhishGuard uses machine learning to protect you from phishing attacks
in real time. Unlike traditional blocklists that only catch known
threats, PhishGuard's AI analyzes every page you visit and detects
phishing attempts that have never been seen before.

### How It Works
- Analyzes URL patterns using a trained XGBoost model (runs locally)
- Scans page content for credential harvesting forms and suspicious code
- Detects brand impersonation through visual similarity analysis
- Blocks known threats via continuously updated threat intelligence feeds
- Warns you with a clear overlay before you enter credentials

### Privacy First
- All fast-path analysis runs entirely on your device
- No browsing history is ever collected or transmitted
- URLs are only sent to our server when local analysis is inconclusive
  AND you explicitly enable this in settings
- Fully open source — inspect every line of code

### Features
✅ Real-time phishing detection (< 10ms for clear cases)
✅ AI-powered URL classification
✅ Visual brand impersonation detection
✅ Anti-evasion: catches Browser-in-the-Browser attacks
✅ Redirect chain analysis
✅ Automatic threat feed updates every 6 hours
✅ Works in incognito mode
✅ Zero tracking, zero ads, zero data collection
